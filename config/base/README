SOSBASE is a SOS configuration that is intended for bridging your PC and motes.  
Since SOS treats your PC just another node in the network, 
your PC should have distinct node address.  This is by default to be 
65534.  This means that UART_ADDR should be 65534 on the mote side.  
If you intend to use modd_gw as your PC side module insertion tool, modd_gw 
should run as 65534 as well.  

When you change modd_gw address, please remember to change UART_ADDR in the 
Makefile to the same number.  

NOTE: if you decide to change modd_gw address, do not use 65533.
