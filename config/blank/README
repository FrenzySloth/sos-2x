To use the new sensing sub-system on Tmote, compile blank
with

make tmote install MODE=new_sensing_api SB=tmote ADDRESS=2 ....

Then, go to the $(SOSROOT)/modules/sensordrivers/tmote/new_api/
to compile and load individual sensor drivers as required.
The test module to test all those sensor drivers is in 
$(SOSROOT)/modules/sensordrivers/tmote/new_api/test/
