SOSage, the SOS VMWare Appliance
================================

SOSage is a virtual machine image based on Ubuntu Linux Desktop. We
installed all the necessary libraries and tools to compile, debug, and run
SOS applications. This will make sure that you have the necessary
dependencies and that we can easily reproduce errors you encounter.

Where to Get SOSage
--------------------------
You can download the latest SOSage from the
link:download.html[downloadpage]. Note that the compressed virtual machine
is about 1.2 GB and might thus take a while to download from our servers.

How to Use SOSage
----------------------------

- You need to get VMWare Player from the VMWare website
  link:http://www.vmware.com/download/player/[http://www.vmware.com/download/player/]. The player is currently only
  available for Linux and Windows. If you are using Mac OS X, you need to
  use VMWare for Mac Beta
  link:http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/[http://www.vmware.com/products/beta/fusion/].
  Note that you can also use VMWare Server, but this application bigger
  and more complicated to use.
- Once you installed the VMWare Player, run the appliance by opening
  the SOS_Appliance.vmx file.
- The user name is nesl, password nesl.
- Go to ''Tabs->Removable Devices->USB Devices'' and make sure
  that the mote you want to program has a check mark. This
  enables the virtual machine to take control over the mote and
  creates USB serial devices for the communication.
