Makerules:

- It gives some debug options. The two debug options are CC_DEBUG and AS_DEBUG. 
- It sets up the sys_jump_table at 0x8c. Is it fine to have it hardcoded in?

- If the BUILD is for _SOS_KERNEL_
     - A set of srcs and asms are included.
     - For _MODULE_ BUILD, no sources are included

- The makefile also defines the avr build option which builds the elf, elf.lst, srec and objs 
- Finally the makefile verifys the built avr image using a perl script
