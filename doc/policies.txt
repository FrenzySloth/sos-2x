Policy Guide
============

Following are some guidelines we want to follow:

- We will try to make regular releases. Each release will be in the
tags directory and should not be changed, unless a bug is critical and
makes the release unusable!

- New features and bug fixes get only added to trunk. The commit
message of new features should be marked by a specific keyword (e.g.
"feature: "), the one for bug fixes with "bugfix:". This way we can
make an easy changelog for each release by parsing the log messages.

- If we have a couple of new features and bug fixes in the trunk, then we
are ready for a new release :)

- If you make major changes on the system, branch it. This should be
used for anything which will take longer than, let's say a week. Once
the development is done, merge your branch back into trunk and rename
the branch (i.e. use `svn mv`) to "xy-FINISHED" to prevent further commits.

- Each developer can have its own branch, if he/she so desires. This can
help his/her research by preventing other people changing files he/she is
not aware of but not loosing the capabilities of logging his/her changes on
the code.

- We should start using the bug tracking system of Savane to track
bugs

The same counts for bigger tasks we want to assign to someone
