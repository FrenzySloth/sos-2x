SOS 2.x Home Page
=================

.{date}: SOS Release {revision} soon
*************************************************************************
We were hard working today for a SOS release, but didn't quiet get there.
But you can expect a first release soon. Also the website is still under
construction since some of the tutorial files are missing and some of the
instructions not 100% tested. This should happen within the next week.

Introduction to SOS
--------------------

SOS is an operating system for mote-class wireless sensor networks
developed by the link:http://nesl.ee.ucla.edu[Networked and
Embedded Systems Lab (NESL)] at UCLA.  SOS uses a common kernel
that implements messaging, dynamic memory, module loading and
unloading, and other services.  SOS uses dynamically loaded software
modules to create a system supporting dynamic addition, modification,
and removal of network services.

Motivations Behind SOS
----------------------

Dynamic reconfigurability is one primary motivation and goal for SOS. In the
domain of wireless sensor networking, reconfigurability is the ability to
modify the software on individual nodes of a sensor network after the
network has been deployed and initialized. This provides the ability to
incrementally update the sensor network after it is deployed, add new
software modules to a sensor node after deployment, and remove unused
software modules when they are no longer needed. The growing tensions
between large, hard-to-update networks and complex applications with
incremental patches has made reconfigurability an issue that can no longer
be ignored.

Creating an expressive system that provides programmers with commonly needed
services is a second primary goal for SOS. Many sensor network applications
need access to the same primitives ranging from memory pools for easy data
packet management to application diagnostic network services such as
neighborhood discovery.

To these ends, SOS takes traditional operating system ideas and transforms
them into a form appropriate for the resource-constrained domain of wireless
sensor nodes. This results in a flexible system that can be used to write
clean and easy to maintain sensor network node systems. 

Reasons To Use SOS
------------------

- Ability to reconfigure individual components of a deployed system.
- Enables heterogeneous system deployments.
- Easy program development:
  * Programs written using standard C code and compilers.
  * Kernel support for common services such as dynamic memory allocation,
    simple garbage collection, and priority scheduling.
- Truly modular system development. The modules that are used to create an
  application remain modular when deployed in the network.
- Debugging support via standard C code debuggers such as GDB. [Note that
  JTAG support for debugging modules is a work in progress.]
- Simulation support on PC using SOS code compiled to PC target or using
  Avrora with SOS code compiled to AVR target.
- Broad platform support including a wide range of the Crossbow Mica Mote
  series and Moteiv Tmote Sky.
