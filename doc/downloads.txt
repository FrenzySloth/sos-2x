Subversion Access
-----------------
You can find instructions on how to get access to the development version on
the link:http://projects.nesl.ucla.edu/svn/?group=sos-2x[SOS projects site].
You can also view the code online on the
link:https://projects.nesl.ucla.edu/view/viewcvs.cgi/sos-2x/trunk/[viewcvs
website]. One last possibility is to
link:https://projects.nesl.ucla.edu/view/viewcvs.cgi/sos-2x/trunk.tar.gz?view=tar[download a tarball] of the trunk, i.e.,
the latest developer version of SOS. Note that this tarball is not directly
supported by the SOS team but bug reports and bugfixes against such a
tarball are more than welcom.
