Static Kernel
=============

The typical mechanism of using SOS consists of first compiling a blank kernel image
and then dynamically loading different application modules to it as described in 
the earlier portions of the tutorial.

However, in some situations it is not possible to employ this mechanism. Some 
examples are compiling SOS for a sim target or wanting to use a jtag debugger.

In this case, it is possible to compile a static kernel where the kernel and the 
modules are all compiled into a single image. A tutorial on how to do this can be 
found under link:blink_sim.html[SOS Simulation of Blink]. Follow the entire
tutorial but change the make target from sim to the desired platform.
