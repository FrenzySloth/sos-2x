Installation Instructions
=========================

This section will guide you through the process of downloading and installing 
the toolchain required to use SOS on your system.

The installation process requires that you:

- Obtain SOS 2.x
- Install libraries and tools for cross compilation
- Build and configure SOS utilities

This document assumes that your system has basic build tools such as gcc 
and a text editor (for instance, vi) already installed. 

These instructions have been tested on the following systems:

- Debian Linux (or some derivative like Ubuntu) 
- Power PC based Mac (Mac OS X 10.4.*) 
- Intel based Mac (Mac OS X 10.4.*)
- Windows XP machine running Cygwin. 


Debian Linux (eg. Ubuntu)
-------------------------

.Obtain SOS 2.x
- Begin by installing some extra libraries used to compile the tool chain 
and SOS tools.  The following command should do the trick under Ubuntu:

[c]
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
apt-get install flex subversion cvs libc6-dev
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Checkout the SOS 2.x source. Use the following command for anonymous
checkout:

[c]
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
svn co svn://projects.nesl.ucla.edu/sos-2x/trunk
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Setup some environment variables before proceeding further. The installation
scripts depend on these variables for correct functioning. Edit the file
~/.bashrc with your favorite editor (vim) and add the following line
(you might have to change some paths depending on your setup):

[c]
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
# SOSROOT points to the trunk directory of SOS 2.x downloaded on your system
export SOSROOT=~/sos-2x/trunk

# SOSTOOLDIR points to the directory where you want to install the toolchain.
# Keeping it in your home directory removes the need to have administrator
# (or root) privileges while installing the toolchain.
export SOSTOOLDIR=~/local

# Add the ./bin directory of the toolchain into the PATH
export PATH=$SOSTOOLDIR/bin:$PATH
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NOTE: Make sure that the environment variables are set by either closing and 
reopening your terminal or sourcing the file with source ~/.bashrc. Next, create 
that folder with the following command: 

[c]
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mkdir $SOSTOOLDIR.
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Install Libraries for Cross-compilation
- The AVR Tool Chain for Mica2 and Micaz
	* You will now need to install the following tool chain for cross compiling SOS 
	to the AVR target. Note that SOS tool chain is sensitive to versions. You are 
	free to experiment with more recent versions of these tools, but the SOS team 
	currently supports the versions listed below:
		. binutils-2.15
		. gcc-core-3.4.3
		. avr-libc-1.4.5
	* Make sure that you have defined the environment variable SOSTOOLDIR.
	* To install the above tools, execute in terminal:

[c]
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
cd $SOSROOT/tools/src/avrgcc
sh avrgcc.sh
code~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	
TIP: Open the avrgcc.sh script in a text editor to see the sequence of
commands followed to download, compile and install the required tools.
It also copies the correct pre-compiled binary of uisp which is 
required to program the embedded target.
