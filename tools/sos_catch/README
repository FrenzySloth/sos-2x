SOS Catch is a tool for connecting custom message handlers to an SOS server.

AUTHOR
-------
Written by Peter Mawhorter (code largely copied from test_sossrv_client.c).

USAGE
-------
./sos_catch.exe [-h] [-cPORT] [-rADDRESS]

Flag summary:
  -cPORT      Connect  Connect to sossrv on port PORT. Default is 7915.
  -h          Help     Display this message and quit.
  -rADDRESS   Remote   Connect to sossrv at ADDRESS (a dotted-decimal IP
                       address). Default is localhost.

ABOUT
-------
This code is a simplification of the sos_server API. At the moment, it is
configured to subscribe to messages from a running sossrv.exe and print the
data contained within Surge messages recieved. Running it while you have a
newtork of motes sending Surge data to the base station should allow you to see
the actual Surge data. The tool's purpose is to simplify the writing of C code
for handling SOS messages: just write a function called "catch" that has the
same specs as the catch function in the catch_surge.c file. Then change the
include statement in sos_catch.c to include your custom code instead of
catch_surge.c. You may have to alter the makefile so that your code will be
able to find the headers it needs. Finally, recompile sos_catch. Then new
executable should subscribe your function to all SOS messages. If you only want
to process a certain type of message, use conditionals in your catch function.

TESTING
-------
Run the SOS Surge tutorial at:

https://projects.nesl.ucla.edu/public/sos-2x/doc/tutorial/surge_mica2.html

Once you're getting messages at the base station (you'll see them appear in the
sos_server terminal), run sos_catch.exe in another terminal. For each message
printed to the sos_server screen, a message should be printed to the sos_catch
screen. The sos_catch printout should look similar, and if the message is a
Surge message (type 34), the sos_catch window should display a detailed listing
of the entire message contents, including a line for Reading which contains the
sensor reading. Now cover up the photosensor on the MTS310 and watch the
reading number change in the Surge packets.
