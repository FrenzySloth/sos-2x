The H34C can be used with either Mica2 or MicaZ motes if the accelerometer outputs are configured for ADC 1-3. ADC4 is somehow broken on at least the MicaZ. They might work on the Mica2. Thus, we currently don't use Vref as an other ADC input to measure the 0g value.

We also don't use tout, the temperature which the H34C chip provides. This might get included later on.

If you want to build your own H34C sensor board, all the sources you need can be found here:
