The H34C sensor board can currently only be used by the MicaZ mote. The sensor board is configured to use ADC1-3 for X, Y, and the Z-axis respectively. Since ADC1 is used for the CC1000 radio on the Mica2, it can not be used. Because of some strange reason, reconfiguring the sensorboard to use ADC4 for X adds an offset to the value and decreases the ADC sensitivity. This does not happen with ADC1 on the MicaZ.
