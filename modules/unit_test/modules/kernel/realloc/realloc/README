Test for sys_realloc:
====================

a simple test to ensure that realloc will allocate additional memory for a module, and copy the previously assigned data correctly.

on each timeout, the current count, and node state are sent.  A newly allocated piece of memory is then expanded by using realloc, and if any values are not copied correctly, then TEST_FAIL is sent.

to run this test:
1) install a blank kernel on the mote
2) use sos_tool to install: modules/unit_test/modules/kernel/realloc/realloc/realloc.mlf
3) run the python script modules/unit_test/modules/kernel/realloc/realloc/realloc.py to observe the results

additional dependencies:
-- sys_free
