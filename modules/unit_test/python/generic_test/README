this directory includes the 3 needed files for any test.  included are a Makefile, a .c file which should be loaded onto the node, and a python script which will be run on the server and check the output from sossrv.

a simple python script is provided which will copy the filles, and modify the default test.lst file to include your new test.

to use it simply do:
  -- python make_new.py sensor_name_here sensor_location_here test_name_here test_location_here test_duration_here
       .. it is assumed that the sensor driver location is correct and already exists with the given file names
       .. it requires 5 arguements, which are essentially the items you would enter into the test.conf file
	    -- please be sure to read how to properly edit the test.conf file before using this
       .. if the test location directories don't exist already, the script will make them for you
       .. it then will copy the needed files into the directory and modify the test.conf file as needed
       .. also, the script can be run from any directory without modifying the arguements 

for example, running with:
  python make_new.py accel_sensor /modules/sensordrivers/mts310/accel accel_test /sensordrivers/mts310/accel 4
will do the following:
  1) modify the test.conf file with a new test that will have the following entries:
	@generic_test
	accel_sensor
	/modules/sensordrivers/mts310/accel
	accel_test 
	/sensordrivers/mts310/accel
	4
  2) then, it will check to make sure that the given test pathname is complete with all the needed folders, and making folders that do not currently exist.  ie, it will ensure that $SOSROOT/modules/unit_test/modules/sensordrivers/mts310/accel exits
  3) next, the .c and .py files will be copied to the given test folder with the names accel_test.c and accel_test.py
  4) finall, a Makefile will be created with accel_test as the PROJ value.

this is simply a template test that provides the basics for most tests.  It is recomended that you make use of these since it will allow you to focus on driver specific details rather than setting up the module correctly.  

It is also recomended that you place all test files under $SOSROOT/modules/unit_test/modules, since that is the location the test_suite will be rooted from for finding tests.
